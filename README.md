# High Dimentional Spectroscopy Data Analysis for Tire Forensics

This R script is designed for the analysis of spectroscopy data in the context of forensic science, specifically focusing on tire analysis. The implementation leverages a suite of statistical and machine learning libraries to process, visualize, and analyze spectroscopic data obtained from tire samples. The objective is to identify distinctive patterns and characteristics that can be used to match tire marks found at crime scenes to specific tire brands or models.

The script incorporates various data preprocessing techniques, exploratory data analysis (EDA) methods, and statistical tests to uncover insights from the data. Visualization tools like ggplot2 and GGally are extensively used to create insightful plots and correlation matrices, aiding in the understanding of data relationships. Advanced modeling techniques, facilitated by libraries such as caret and neuralnet, are employed to build predictive models that can classify tire marks based on their spectroscopic signatures.

Key functionalities include:

* Data cleaning and normalization to prepare the spectroscopic data for analysis.
* Exploratory data analysis to investigate underlying patterns and trends within the tire samples.
* Application of statistical tests to assess the significance of observed differences among tire samples.
* Development of predictive models to accurately classify tire marks, enhancing forensic investigations.
  
This script is a vital tool for forensic analysts aiming to utilize spectroscopy data in tire examinations, providing a data-driven approach to support criminal investigations and legal proceedings.
